  HNI/Temporary Fashion Museum

  September 2015 till May 2016


  The upper floor of the Temporary Fashion Museum in Het Nieuwe Instituut in
  Rotterdam had been turned into Fashion Machine, a large installation, part of
  the exhibition Fashion Data, which showed the fight against the destructive
  reality of fashion industry.

  Fashion designer Conny Groenewegen designed it and put it in motion and she
  did so in cooperation with graphic designer Rudy Guedj. He demonstrated on
  posters in clear lines what was going on in these spaces filled with
  volunteers and miles of fleece threads.


  Fashion Data incorporates Fashion Machine: an installation by Conny
  Groenewegen in which she and her team cut up and re-work a typical leftover
  product of the fast fashion/clothing industry, the fleece sweater. Together
  with a large group of volunteers they cut up and ‘re-spun’ the fleeces onto
  giant spools and looped them onto huge knitting benches’ to demonstrate the
  scale of waste and the banality of the fleece jumper, which is largely
  undesired as a second-hand product and regularly finds its way into mattresses
  at the end of its lifecycle, or worse still, landfill. Conny makes
  thought-provoking statements about the role of designers in mass manufacturing
  for fast fashion.
