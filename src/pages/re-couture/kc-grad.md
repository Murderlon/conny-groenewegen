Many thanks to Art director of KC Grad in Belgrade, Ljudmila Stratimirovic and the Sirogojno knitting ladies.

The GRAD European Centre for Culture and Debate, also known as KC GRAD, Belgrade (Serbia)

Cape and sweater design inspired by traditional patterns of knitwear from Sirogojno with outstanding colors and detail. Therefore, each piece has the aura of cultural heritage as an added value. Transferring legacy of the past into the modern era themed around the craftsmanship techniques from the Balkans. Project Exploring Inspirations is supported by Creative Industries Fund Netherlands.
