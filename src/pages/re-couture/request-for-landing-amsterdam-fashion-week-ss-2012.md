description: "Every idea that shaped in my head immediately died to give birth to something that I did not foresee. It taught me to trust the moment and my own ability to step it on the tail instead of trying to construct it upfront. The designs are very much the results of this process as they have the same weightlessness. I somehow hope to transfer this feeling of weightlessness to a woman the moment she will wear my designs. With the femininity of fine lace like knits in dynamic loose shapes. The color ranges from butter color to black through Yves Klein blue, a mediterranean green with shades of nude. If you want, you can see the expression of the life span of a butterfly, temporary and intense. Now only the butterflies need to land, to find their place amongst the public.\n\nPhotography: Peter Stigter. Catwalk design: Ontwerpplek.nl. Set styling: Lyse Martel.
