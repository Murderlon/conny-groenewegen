description: "SALON BEIJING 2013\n\n360 DEGREE SHELTER\nDuring SALON Beijing the design studio of Conny Groenewegen will be temporarily relocated from Amsterdam to Beijing. The existing silhouettes which were co-developed by Monika Lovas, will be developed further and locally customized. The designer offers a personal consultation and a bespoke cape design upon request.\n\nThe cape as a dynamic shape around the body will define one’s intimate personal space within the public domain. While it emphasizes one’s individuality which gives strength to the wearer it also has characteristics of a uniform. To increase protection, the capes are hand waxed. The wax gives a stiff appeal to its already abstract shape.\n\nPhotography: Jan Willem Kaldenbach . SALON Beijing\_. Design Week Beijing 2013 . Special thanks to: Manon Schaap, Gijs Stork, City of Amsterdam, residents of Xizhimen Hutong for their hospitality and hands on support\n"
