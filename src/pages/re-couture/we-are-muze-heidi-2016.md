HEIDI

As a choreographer I often collaborate in the design world, so I was extremely happy when Melanie and Conny asked to meet me for a possible choreographic collaboration. I’d purchased a few BYBROWN designs in the past and I got to know the other designers through the We Are Muze website.

From our first conversations to our photo shoot I felt so at home. Somehow we were all on the same page about wanting to share ideas and see how exchanging them could shift and inspire our individual work. We all want to build a strong cross disciplinary community, where one medium can influence the other, whether it be film, fashion, textile design, performance, teaching, choreography ….
