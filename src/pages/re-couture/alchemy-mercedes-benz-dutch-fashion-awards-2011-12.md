ALCHEMY, AUTUMN/WINTER 2012/13

The Autumn/Winter 2012/13 collection is inspired by ‘alchemy’ and the mysterious transformations that colour our mind, body and spirit. Each intarsia knit garment is processed with a hot dye that changes color and character of used materials like wool, wild silk and copper. This ‘alchemical process’ which allows to integrate and define the shape for each design resulted in a fascinating balance between traditional craftsmanship and innovation.

Extra: Mercedes-Benz Dutch Fashion Award winner —2011
