It was inspired by the scenario that playwright Rob de Graaf created for the audio tour. Each of the installation's four tableaux represent the protagonist at different points in her journey. The narrative is cyclic, with the protagonist always returning to the sea before being reborn the next day, to start her journey anew.\n\ncredits: \nconcept and choreography: Peter Leung | film direction and editing:\_Altin\_Kaftira | dance: Erica\_Horwood, Jared Wright, Matthew\_Pawlicki, Remy Catalan, Edo\_Wijnen | director of photography: Daniel\_Gallenkamp\nlight: Glenn\_Bruintjes visagie\_| make-up: Merle\_Holterman | set dresser: Anne\_Heijligers | dress: Conny Groenewegen | production:\_Rosan\_Boersma\_voor\_SelfmadeFilms\_en Gerrit Jan Smeenk for Het Nationale Ballet \nWith thanks to: Het\_Nationale\_Ballet, De\_Lakenhal."
