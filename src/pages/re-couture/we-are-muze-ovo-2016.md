description: "OVO\nPhoto series by Gilleam Trapenberg\n\nMy photography is very much influenced by my childhood.\_I grew\_up in Curacao where there are certain cultural codes as to what it means to be a man\_and often a lot of\_importance is put on\_appearance. This has a big influence on my work seeing as I mainly touch on themes of status, identity and the current image culture. I believe that certain objects and situations should be left the way they are. This often results in an interesting dynamic between me and the subject being portrayed. I would not necessarily call myself a documentary photographer. I often use the documentary aesthetic, but I am far more interested in the blurring of different photographic genres.\n\nPhotography – Gilleam Trapenberg\LModel – Ovo Drenth\LHair and make up – Kira Kroegman\LStyling – Robert Risteski\nArt direction – Koos Breen\nDesigns – We Are Muze – Jessica Joyce, LoveLuha, BYBROWN, ELECTRIC CO\nWith thanks to – Karla Vincheva, We Are Muze\nCreative direction & concept – Conny Groenewegen\n\nVideo: Milena Seculic\n"
