description: "A/W 2014 collection \"Primary Explorers\", opening show at Tokyo Fashion Week, is the outcome of an enduring and consistent research which brings us to a sculptural and tailored series of garments. The 'heavy' fabrics are firmly compressed and wrinkled, soaking up water and oxygen with a delicate skin of silk fabric sticking to it. The models look like elemental travellers. It is about structure and thin layers of time.\n\nWith thanks to\_Dutch Fashion Foundation, Mercedes Benz Tokyo Fashion Week, Els Roseboom Fashion and Pattern Design.\nPhotography: TFW"
