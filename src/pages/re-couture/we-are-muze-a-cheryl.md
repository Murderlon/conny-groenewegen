‘A CHERYL’ 

CASTING SHOOT TEASER

‘A Cheryl’ is the concept We Are Muze has been developing in collaboration with the photographer and muse Cheryl Schurgers. The shoot of the casting for Cheryl lookalikes took place on July 6th 2017 at the wonderful Studio 13 in Amsterdam.

Eleven girls were reached out to via the casting call poster and were then selected to participate in the official casting shoot. At the casting, each of them had to imitate Cheryl both in looks and the way they acted.

Instructed to come all in black, the participants were then invited to enter the world of Cheryl and We Are Muze by dressing in the SS18 pieces of BYBROWN, Electric Co, Jessica Joyce and LoveLuha.

Under the direction of Cheryl herself, the girls were instructed to perform four different acts, each of which represented a translation of the alter ego theme by the We Are Muze designers.

The casting could not go without the jury, who, with their critical eye, observed the acts and decided who is good enough to be a Cheryl and perform at the next stage of the project.

The whole process of the casting and the shooting was filmed by Julius Thissen, whose work was a key element in the We Are Muze presentation on September 27th 2017 in Atelier Neérlandais during Paris Fashion Week. As well the editorial of this not so usual casting will be exhibited during the same presentation next to another ‘A CHERYL’ casting as performance with French Cheryl lookalikes and Cheryl Schurgers herself.
